<!--Don't Electronically Change Assets-->
<p>Don't install/remove software without following the change control process. This may also seem obvious, but this can be as simple as bringing a corporate or personal laptop to a facility and transferring your MP3 collection to your workstation to listen to music while you work. Be vigilant.</p>
<p>If you need to get data or software onto your workstation or an asset, use the <b>APS Software Installation Menu</b> or if your selection is not on the installation menu, request it through <b>Get it Here</b> on <b>Inside APS</b>.  </p>

<h1>POTENTIAL ISSUES</h1>
<ul>
<li>Running or installing non-approved software on CRCAs (even if it doesn't require administrator permissions).</li>
<li>Transferring files to an ESP network through unapproved mechanisms.</li>
</ul>
