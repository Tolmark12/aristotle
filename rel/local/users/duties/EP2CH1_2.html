<!--Protect Your PSPs-->
<p>If you have physical access to PSPs, always, always, always scan in and scan out. Always. The easiest way to forget this is to tailgate someone in or out. Tailgating is bad. Tailgating is what caused the fall of the Hydroternal Utility on Nedritux III, allowing the robots to finally breach their defenses. Don't let that happen to you.</p>
<p>If your badge won't open a door to a PSP, you are considered a Visitor and require escort until you are granted access or until access issues are resolved. Don't go around door controls, even if you think you should have access.</p>
<p>If you do or see someone enter or leave a PSP without scanning, contact Security immediately so they can manually document the PSP visit, ensure we have evidence of compliance and provide coaching to the employee.</p>
