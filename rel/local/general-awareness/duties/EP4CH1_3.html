<!--Maintain Your Defender Status-->
<p>When requested to do so, take the cyber security training required every year and cooperate with Corporate Security every seven years to renew your background check.</p>
<p>Please refrain from illegal activities - don't install dopamine-enhancing microchip implants or drug synthesis chips and don't deal them. Definitely don't randomly laser-blast someone or use wasteland-survival skills on anyone except in self-defense or unless you're pretty sure they are a robot. Keep that background check clean.</p>
<h1>POTENTIAL ISSUES</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Not completing cyber-security training each year.</li>
    <li>Not having an updated background check every seven years.</li>
    <li>Joining the Robo-Workers Party</li>
    <li>Not self-reporting any personal arrest as soon as possible. In this case, personnel <u>may not access a CIP Related Cyber Asset until their immediate APS leader <i>and</i> APS Corporate Security authorize them to do so</u>.
   		<p>An arrest occurs when:</p>
   		<ul>
   		<li>A law enforcement agency takes an individual into custody or issues a criminal citation to the individual</li>
		<li>The individual is the subject of an arrest warrant</li>
		<li>The individual receives a criminal indictment by a Grand Jury or other legal proceeding</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Failure to report an arrest to your leader and Corporate Security, may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
