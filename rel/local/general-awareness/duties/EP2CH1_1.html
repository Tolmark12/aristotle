<!--Know Your PSPs-->
<p>Badge readers are the primary way for you to access PSPs. We know everyone wants APS to use Kraken Sensors, but they just weren't practical in this desert heat. Our badge readers look like this:</p>
<p><img class='float-right' src='badge-reader.png' /></p>
<p>Access to the PSPs at the <b>Four Corners Power Plant</b> and the in-scope substation control houses are restricted and access is controlled by badge reader. Additionally, substation control houses are equipped with ring down phones to Corporate Security.  PSPs are clearly identified with signs. </p>
<p>If you work at the <b>Energy Control Center/DOMS EMS Room</b> in Deer Valley or the <b>Backup Control Center/502 Data Center</b> at the 502 Building, access is controlled by badge reader and requires a PIN code be entered first.</p>
