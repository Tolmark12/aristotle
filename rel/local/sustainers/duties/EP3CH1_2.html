<!--Sustain the Port Defenses-->
<p>You may be responsible for configuring port defenses, be they firewalls, TCP wrappers, port plugs, or configuration to follow the Ports & Services Expected State Process. For ports open by choice or because port controls arenâ€™t supported, you may be asked to help document the reason.</p>
<h1>POTENTIAL ISSUES</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Not disabling physical ports on a CRCA</li>
    <li>Not sustaining logical port controls on a CRCA.</li>
    <li>Not documenting exceptions for open logical ports with the Compliance Team</li>
</ul>
