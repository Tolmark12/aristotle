<!--Verify Minimum Privileges-->
<p>Once a quarter, you will be asked by the Regulatory  to help verify that individuals with access to your systems have valid authorization records. It is your job to provide an accurate list of persons with access to your systems. The purpose of this is to ensure that only authorized users have access; this is not a full evaluation of privileges.</p>
<p>Once a year (at least every 15 calendar months), Regulatory will coordinate the effort to evaluate all roles and permissions, confirming that each role has the correct specific privileges and the minimum necessary to do the job.</p>
<h1>POTENTIAL ISSUES</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Not performing your quarterly and annual reviews in the time limits</li>
    <li>Not providing an accurate list of authorized personnel for the quarterly evaluation</li>
</ul>
