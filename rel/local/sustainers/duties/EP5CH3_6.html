<!--Maintain the Recovery Plan-->
<p>It is your responsibility to ensure that plans are created for back up and storage of information for each class of asset that you have responsibility for. Ensure that recovery plans are detailed enough to provide real value in the event of use. </p>
<p>Keep the plan current with changes to your team and assets. Any changes must be reflected in the plan inside 60 days. </p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> Recovery checklists that can be printed out in a crisis are a best practice. </p>
</p>
