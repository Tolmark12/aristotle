<!--Follow Change Control Processes-->
<p>Any acts that change a CRCA must follow the change control procedure to ensure that:
<ol>
<li>Baseline configurations are created/updated</li>
<li>Security impacts are assessed and mitigated</li>
<li>The changes are approved before the assets receive their changes.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>When removing existing CRCAs, it is your responsibility to follow all the steps of your change control procedures to ensure that the BCSI is properly removed before the asset leaves a PSP.</p>
<h1>POTENTIAL ISSUES</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Making any hardware or software changes to CRCAs without following the change control procedure</li>
    <li>Removing an CRCA from a PSP without properly disposing of the device.</li>
</ul>
