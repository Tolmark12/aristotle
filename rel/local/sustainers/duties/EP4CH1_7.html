<!--Configure Access For Defenders-->
<p>If you are responsible for configuring CRCAs, you may have responsibility to assign permissions in systems after the PRA approval process is completed. When giving a new user access to devices, handle this job with the utmost care. When removing someone's access, perform that removal in a timely manner - you only have 24 hours to remove access when an employee is terminated.</p>
<h1>POTENTIAL ISSUES</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Not disabling physical access to any PSP(s) within 24 hours of termination</li>
    <li>Not disabling interactive remote access within 24 hours of termination</li>
    <li>Not disabling access to BCSI locations by the end of the next calendar day following termination</li>
    <li>Not revoking non-shared accounts within 30 days of termination</li>
    <li>Still reading? Yeah, there's a lot</li>
    <li>Not changing shared passwords within 30 days of termination</li>
    <li>Giving someone access before the full approval process has been completed</li>
    <li>Giving the wrong person access after the approval process has been completed</li>
    <li>Giving the right person the wrong access after the approval process has been completed</li>
    <li>Not responding in the negative when a double negative response is not requested</li>
</ul>
<p>These may all seem like minor infractions, but bear robo-strophic consequences when robots march with impunity inside our perimeters.</p>
