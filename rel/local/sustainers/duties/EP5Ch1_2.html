<!--Respond to Unauthorized Access-->
<p>Members of the ISS team are responsible for looking for and responding to unauthorized electronic access. Either through automated or manual means, we must collect and process all electronic security, alert appropriately, restore logging capabilities after failure, and retain the information for at least 90 days.</p>
<p>This includes checking for unauthorized changes to our systems. Make sure this happens in the 35-day timeframe according to the Electronic Security Logging and Event Monitoring Process and that any issues are reported for investigation.</p>
