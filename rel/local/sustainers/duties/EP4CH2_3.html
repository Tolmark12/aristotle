<!--Force CRCA Accounts to Comply-->
<p>You may be requested to help identify shared accounts and update their passwords annually (at least every 15 months) on CRCAs you sustain. You may also be requested to identify default accounts and disable them or change their passwords.</p>
<p>Since you maintain these CRCAs, you will set up controls on these systems to enforce password complexity, automatic password change rules, and account lockouts/alerts. Please work with Regulatory to ensure settings are configured properly.</p>
<h1>POTENTIAL ISSUES</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Not performing the recurring password-change tasks in a timely manner.</li>
    <li>Not setting a password of the right complexity</li>
    <li>Not configuring rules for password complexity, automatic password changes, and account lockout/alerting.</li>
</ul>
