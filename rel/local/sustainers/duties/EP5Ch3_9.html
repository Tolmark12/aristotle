<!--Secure Forensic Data-->
<p>If you're involved in a real incident, do what you reasonably can to secure data that may be useful for authorities after the incident is over.</p>
<p>For example, if you reported a suspicious vehicle and took a picture of the license plate, don't lose that information. If you saw strange spacecraft operating over the facility, don't lose those pictures either - no one will believe you anyways without a picture.</p>
<p>Try not to delete relevant emails, remove information from CRCA's, or destroy information that might be useful in an investigation.</p>
<h1>POTENTIAL ISSUES</h1>
<p>Not retaining records relevant to an actual incident</p>
