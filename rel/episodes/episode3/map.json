CIP also requires that we detect unauthorized electronic activity and alert Defenders if we detect something malicious. <br/>The most common way to meet the CIP requirements is to install Firewall between the ESP network and other networks. Firewalls can prevent unauthorized messages from getting through and often come equipped with Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) that inspect the contents of electronic messages and alert Defenders if something malicious is found.
