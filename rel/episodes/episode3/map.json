We install door controls that only allow authorized Defenders inside the PSP, log all access attempts, and alert when unauthorized people (or robots) try to gain access. Our Medium Impact facilities have one control, while High Impact facilities require two independent controls per access point. <br/>These access control devices are called Physical Access Control Systems (PACS). An example of a PACS is an ID-badge reader on the outside of the door connected to a computer inside that operates the reader and does logging and alerting.
