<!--Patch Those Assets-->
<p>If you belong to the ISS group, you must assess each security patch within 35 days of discovery.</p>
<p>The system teams and asset owners must apply that patch or document a mitigation plan inside 35 days of assessment. This process is defined in the <b>Security Patch Management Process</b>. To mitigate patches, work with ISS to define, document and execute a mitigation plan.</p>
