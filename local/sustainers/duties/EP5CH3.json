		<p>It is your responsibility to ensure that plans are created for back up and storage of information for each class of asset that you have responsibility for. Ensure that recovery plans are detailed enough to provide real value in the event of use. </p>

		<p>When an asset is fried to a crisp or a facility is unavailable because of a Cyber Security Incident, don't lose hope. We have a Recovery Plan to handle this. Everyone can have a part to play in recovery, so be ready to support the instructions of the Recovery Team.</p>
		<p>For small events, you may just need to give the IT people space to do their job. An encouraging word and a drink go a long way towards reducing stress that may arise with the recovery team on these occasions.</p>
		<p>However, for large incidents like a control center becoming unavailable, you may have a more significant contribution. Your schedule may change and you may need to work from a different location for a time.</p>
		<h1>POTENTIAL ISSUES</h1>

		    <li>Not following the recovery plan after a crisis.</li>
		    <li>When oil hits the fan - running around, screaming instead of calmly following your recovery plan.</li>

		<p>If you're involved in a real incident, do what you reasonably can to secure data that may be useful for authorities after the incident is over.</p>
