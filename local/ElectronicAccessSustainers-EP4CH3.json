<h1>Escort Visitors</h1>
<p>Always follow the visitor access procedure when taking a visitor into a PSP. This can easily be forgotten, especially with people that you see every day who don't have full physical access. Don’t get comfortable! An experienced MimeBot can easily mind-flay you with pickup lines that tempt you to let them in.</p>
<h2>POTENTIAL ISSUES</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Entering a PSP without access or without an escort.</li>
    <li>Taking a visitor into a PSP without following the Visitor Escort Procedure.</li>
    <li>Leaving your escort in the PSP or being left in the PSP if you are being escorted.</li>
    <li>Not letting a visitor out of a PSP to use the bathroom. FYI - a visitor who never needs to use the bathroom may be a robot.</li>
</ul>
