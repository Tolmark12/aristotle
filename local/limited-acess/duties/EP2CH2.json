		<p>If you have access to a PSP, that means you have access to CRCAs attached to an ESP network. Never, never, never change the network cabling on assets without following the change control procedure.</p>

		    <li>Attaching or removing assets on the ESP network without following the change control procedure.</li>
		    <li>Connecting CRCAs to different networks (e.g. plugging in a network cable, WiFi adapter or dial-in modem.)</li>
