		<p>When an asset is fried to a crisp or a facility is unavailable because of a Cyber Security Incident, don't lose hope. We have a Recovery Plan to handle this. Everyone can have a part to play in recovery, so be ready to support the instructions of the Recovery Team.</p>
		<p>For small events, you may just need to give the IT people space to do their job. An encouraging word and a drink go a long way towards reducing stress that may arise with the recovery team on these occasions.</p>
		<p>However, for large incidents like a control center becoming unavailable, you may have a more significant contribution. Your schedule may change and you may need to work from a different location for a time.</p>
		<h1>POTENTIAL ISSUES</h1>
		<ul>
		    <li>Not following the recovery plan after a crisis.</li>
		    <li>When oil hits the fan - running around, screaming instead of calmly following your recovery plan.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>If you're involved in a real incident, do what you reasonably can to secure data that may be useful for authorities after the incident is over.</p>
		<p>For example, if you reported a suspicious vehicle and took a picture of the license plate, don't lose that information. If you saw strange spacecraft operating over the facility, don't lose those pictures either - no one will believe you anyways without a picture.</p>
		<p>Try not to delete relevant emails, remove information from CRCA's, or destroy information that might be useful in an investigation.</p>
		<h1>POTENTIAL ISSUES</h1>
		<p>Not retaining records relevant to an actual incident</p>
