		<p>BES Cyber System Information (BCSI) has different access requirements than CRCAs. While assets contain BCSI and should not be removed without following disposal procedures, some BCSI exists as electronic or paper documents. Don't move this information or provide it to third parties without following the sharing and transit procedures. It's very easy to inadvertently create BCSI or allow an unauthorized third party to capture BCSI by simply taking pictures of computer monitors or wallboards with a cell phone camera. Be vigilant.</p>
