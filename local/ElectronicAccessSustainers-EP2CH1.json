             <h1>Know Your PSPs</h1>
<p>Badge readers are the primary way for you to access PSPs. We know everyone wants APS to use Kraken Sensors, but they just weren't practical in this desert heat. Our badge readers look like this:</p>
<p><img class='float-right' src='/local/duty-assets/badge-reader.png' /></p>
<p>Access to the 13 PSPs at the Four Corners Power Plant and the substation buildings at the Medium Impact substations is controlled by badge reader. Substation control houses at 18 substations are also restricted and access is controlled by badge reader. PSPs are clearly identified with signs.</p>
<p>If you work at the Energy Control Center/DOMS EMS Room in Deer Valley or the Backup Control Center/502 Data Center at the 502 Building, access is controlled by badge reader and requires a PIN code be entered first.</p>

                    <h1>Protect Your PSPs</h1>
<p>If you have physical access to PSPs, always, always, always scan in and scan out. Always. The easiest way to forget this is to tailgate someone in or out. Tailgating is bad. Tailgating is what caused the fall of the Hydroternal Utility on Nedritux III, allowing the robots to finally breach their defenses. Don’t let that happen to you.</p>
<p><strong>TIP: Let the door close between each person entering a facility at the same time to ensure everyone scans properly.</strong></p>
<p>If your badge won't open a door to a PSP, you are considered a Visitor and require escort until you are granted access or until access issues are resolved. Don't go around door controls, even if you think you should have access.</p>
<p>If you do or see someone enter or leave a PSP without scanning, contact your leader immediately so they can manually document the PSP visit and ensure we have evidence of compliance.</p>
<h2>POTENTIAL ISSUES</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Not scanning before entering a PSP (following someone in)</li>
    <li>No scanning before exiting a PSP (following someone out)</li>
    <li>Tailgating in</li>
    <li>Tailgating out</li>
    <li>Tailgating both directions</li>
    <li>Tailgating tailgators</li>
    <li>Starting a tailgator congo line</li>
    <li>Yeah, I know. We've said it a lot. But tailgating is one of the most common violations. Be vigilant. Be aware.</li>
    <li>Not reporting if you or someone else entered or exited a PSP without scanning</li>
</ul>
