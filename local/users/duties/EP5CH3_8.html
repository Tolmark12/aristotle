<!--Recover From An Incident-->
<p>When an asset is fried to a crisp or a facility is unavailable because of a Cyber Security Incident, don't lose hope. We have a Recovery Plan to handle this. Everyone can have a part to play in recovery, so be ready to support the instructions of the Recovery Team.</p>
<p>For small events, you may just need to give the IT people space to do their job. An encouraging word and a drink go a long way towards reducing stress that may arise with the recovery team on these occasions.</p>
<p>However, for large incidents like a control center becoming unavailable, you may have a more significant contribution. Your schedule may change and you may need to work from a different location for a time.</p>
<h1>POTENTIAL ISSUES</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Not following the recovery plan after a crisis.</li>
    <li>When oil hits the fan - running around, screaming instead of calmly following your recovery plan.</li>
</ul>
