<!--Don't Mess with the ESP-->
<p>If you have access to a PSP, that means you have access to CRCAs attached to an ESP network. Never, never, never change the network cabling on assets.</p>
<p><strong>TIP:</strong> Just don't touch assets. We know it's tempting.</p>
<h1>POTENTIAL ISSUES</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Attaching or removing assets on the ESP network without following the change control procedure.</li>
    <li>Connecting CRCAs to different networks (e.g. plugging in a network cable, WiFi adapter or dial-in modem.)</li>
</ul>
