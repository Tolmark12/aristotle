<!--Don't Physically Change Assets->
<p>Don't add or remove workstations, servers, or otherwise make any changes to devices without following the change control process. This may seem obvious, but realize that you could inadvertently change something and cause a security breach by plugging your personal device into a CRCA. </p>
<p>The only groups who should be physically adding, updating, or removing assets are the teams that manage those devices. </p>

<h1>POTENTIAL ISSUES</h1>
<ul>
<li>Adding a device to an ESP network. </li>
<li>Removing CRCAs from an ESP network or a PSP. </li>
