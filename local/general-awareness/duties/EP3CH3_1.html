<!--Don't Physically Change Assets-->
<p>The only groups who should be physically adding, updating, or removing assets are the teams that manage those devices.  Generally speaking, you should not add or remove workstations, servers, or otherwise make any changes to devices.</p>
<h1>POTENTIAL ISSUES</h1>
<ul>
<li>Adding a device to an ESP network.</li>
<li>Removing CRCAs from an ESP network or a PSP.</li>
</ul>
