<!--Escort Visitors-->
<p>Always follow the visitor access procedure when taking a visitor into a PSP. This can easily be forgotten, especially with people that you see every day who don't have full physical access. Don't get comfortable! An experienced MimeBot can easily mind-flay you with pickup lines that tempt you to let them in.</p>
<p>APS has specific requirements for visitor access into and out of areas classified as Physical Security Perimeters (PSPs).</p>
<p>The Escort (with authorized unescorted access) has the following responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><u>PRIOR TO ENTRY INTO EACH PSP</u>, ensure all visitors are appropriately logged in and out.</li>
<li>Keep the visitor(s) within line of site at all times; visitors cannot, under any circumstance, be in a PSP without an assigned escort. </li>
<li>Never allow visitors to wander unescorted through PSPs or company facilities. </li>
<li>Only escort up to six visitors at a time. If there are more than six visitors, another escort with authorized unescorted physical access is required to follow the complete escort process for the additional visitors.</li>
<li>If you are escorting a visitor and need to leave the PSP area for any reason, escort the visitor outside of the PSP, or assign the responsibility to another PSP authorized employee/contractor and notify corporate security.</li>
</ul>
<b>To access PSPs at the power plant, Energy Control Center/DOMS EMS Room in Deer Valley or the Backup Control Center/502 Data Center at the 502 Building</b>
<p>The escort (with authorized unescorted access) must follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take visitors to the security office or guard shack to obtain a CIP visitor badge.</li>
<li>Badge/Scan in a bookend badging order, which is as follows:</li>
	<ul>
	<li>The escort badges in</li>
	<li>All visitors badge in</li>
	<li>The escort badges in again</li>
	</ul>
<li>When leaving the PSP the process is the same. The escort badges before and after the visitor badges to create a record of visitor escorting.</li>
<li>Once access is no longer needed, escort the visitor to Security to log their exit and return the CIP PSP badge. </li>
</ul>
<b>To access PSPs at a substation:</b>
<p>The escort (with authorized unescorted access) must follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contact Corporate Security via the substation ring down phone and provide pertinent visitor information. </li>
<li>Escort badge/scan to enter PSP.</li>
<li>The escort must badge/scan when leaving the PSP.</li>
<li>Once access is no longer needed, escort contacts Corporate Security via the ring down phone in order to log their exit. </li>
</ul>
<h1>POTENTIAL ISSUES</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Entering a PSP without access or without an escort.</li>
    <li>Taking a visitor into a PSP without following the Visitor Escort Procedure.</li>
    <li>Leaving your escort in the PSP or being left in the PSP if you are being escorted.</li>
