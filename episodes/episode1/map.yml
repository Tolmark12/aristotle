We still must self-report to our regulator, but regulators look more favorably on these situations. <br/><br/>A Violation is violating a <a data-label="cip">CIP</a> requirement and being caught by an auditor. These can come with big fines, up to $1,000,000 per day, per incident. <br/><br/>Let's run these situations through the simulator and see if you can identify them.

Youch! <br/><br/>So when we violate a <a data-label="cip">CIP</a> requirement, it's always better to issue a Self-Report to our regulator and fix our internal processes so the issue won't happen again. We still may receive a violation, but regulators look more favorably when we catch and fix our own problems. <br/><br/>Since this incident, all Defenders have received BCSI security training. Let's see if this helps avoid a violation.

                body: Nice job, Cadet. Our facility is built, we tagged <a data-label="crca">CRCAs</a> and <a data-label="bcsi">BCSI</a> locations, learned about the <a data-label="manager">CIP Senior Manager</a> and the <a data-label="cyber_security_program">Cyber Security Program</a>, and added <a data-label="defenders">Defender</a>. Most importantly, we learned that our core mission as <a data-label="defenders">Defenders</a> is to protect our infrastructure by performing our duties and creating evidence. <br/><br/>Let's test your knowledge and move onto the next episode where we'll build and secure the perimeters around our facility. Buckle up into your office chairs, because things are about to get really interesting. The robots are coming…
