                body: Our <a data-label="defender">Defenders</a> never removed Rod's door system and workstation accounts after he quit his job, so he still has Physical and Electronic Access. Once a <a data-label="defender">Defender</a> leaves their job, we must disable Physical Access and Electronic Access within 24 hours. This effectively cuts the person off from our facilities and CRCAs. Any user accounts must be completely removed and shared passwords they know changed within 30 days.

When Cindy logs in each morning, she enters a username and password for this user account to validate her identity and access the system. <br/><br/>The robots would love to learn Cindy's username and password, so we must protect her <a data-label="user_account">User Account</a>. This chapter teaches the defenses that keep these accounts from falling into the metallic hands of the robots.
