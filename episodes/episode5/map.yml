                body: Given enough effort, any moat can be bridged and any wall breached if defenders aren't ready to repel the enemy. This episode is about how we detect and respond to <a data-label="cyber_security_incident" class="new">Cyber Security Incidents</a> - actual attacks against our infrastructure.

                title: Keep a Sharp Lookout
                body: All Defenders must be on the lookout for shady persons photographing our facilities, attempting to gain information via phone, email or other means, and doing otherwise shifty things. Disappearance of vehicle passes, personnel identification, uniforms, or BCSI is also suspicious. <br/><br/>Further, if you have <a data-label="electronic_access">Electronic Access</a> to <a data-label="crca">CRCAs</a>, keep an eye out for anything that doesn't seem right on your system. This includes windows or messages that you don't recognize, unusual system slowdowns, files out of place, or otherwise strange system behavior. <br/><br/>Report any of these promptly because an attack may be in progress.

                title: Electronic Monitoring
                body: Nearly all of our <a data-label="crca">CRCAs</a> generate events that may be indications of an attack&#58; unauthorized access, firewall alerts, failed logins, unexpected system changes, and detection of malicious code are just a few examples. <br/><br/>Our technical <a data-label="defender">Defenders</a> - like Richard - must monitor and analyze these events to detect if they represent a <a data-label="cyber_security_incident">Cyber Security Incident</a>. They will also perform regular Vulnerability Assessment on our defenses to proactively look for security problems.

                title: Local and National Response
                body: When our monitoring efforts detect an attack, the <a data-label="cip">Standards</a> require that we convene an <a data-label="team" class="new">Incident Response Team</a> to coordinate our efforts to repel the attackers and a <a data-label="csirp" class="new">Cyber Security Incident Response Plan</a> with processes that ensure our response is swift and effective. <br/><br/>An incursion on our territory might be part of a larger, coordinated attack against the <a data-label="bes">Bulk Electric System</a>, so our Incident Response Team must promptly report significant incidents to <a data-label="nerc">NERC's</a> <a data-label="eisac" class="new">Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center (E-ISAC)</a>. E-ISAC handles response to attacks at the national level.

                title: Maintaining Readiness
                body: We must test our <a data-label="csirp">Cyber Security Incident Response Plan</a> yearly with a simulation and use our lessons-learned to improve the plan. Other events may cause the <a data-label="csirp">Plan</a> to change, like employees moving out of roles, so we must keep the information in the plan up-to-date.

During an actual attack, any <a data-label="defender">Defender</a> may be called upon to assist the <a data-label="team">Team</a>, so we must all be ready. <br/><br/>Our facility Defenders have already been detecting and responding to <a data-label="cyber_security_incident">Cyber Security Incident</a> in each simulated attack, so we'll skip the simulator for this chapter.

The Recovery Plan defines the data backups, spare equipment and parts, and steps needed to restore each type of <a data-label="crca">CRCA<a/>. The Plan also guides Defenders on how to preserve forensic data from the attack needed for subsequent investigations. <br/><br/>Similar to the <a data-label="csirp">Cyber Security Incident Response Plan<a/>, we are expected to keep our Recovery Plan up-to-date and test it yearly. We also must regularly test that our data backups are working and usable for recovery purposes.
