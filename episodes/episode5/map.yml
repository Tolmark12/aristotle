First, after Rod quit his job, they never removed his Physical Access (door system account) and Electronic Access (workstation account), so he can still enter the facility and access the control system. Second, they granted Physical Access to a malicious agent of the robots. Overall, a rotten day for the people of Earth. <br/>Let's start with access removal - once someone leaves a job that requires access, CIP requires that we disable Physical Access and Electronic Access within 24 hours. This effectively cuts the person off from our facilities and assets, and also removes their Information Access to BCSI. Once this is done, user accounts must be completely removed and shared passwords they know changed within 30 days."

Personnel Risk Assessment - Check the person's background for risks and criminal activity <br/>2. Cyber-Security Training - Teach the person about cyber threats and their duties as Defenders. <br/>3.
