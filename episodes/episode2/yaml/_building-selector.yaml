        intro: The CIP Standards require that we protect significant control centers, generation plants, and substations on the Bulk Electric System. Per the Standards, we will classify them as High Impact (big control centers), Medium Impact (significant transmission substations and generation plants) and Low Impact (everything else).
        title: Pick Your Facility
        subTitle: Most of the Standards apply to High and Medium impact facilities, so we'll add a Medium Impact facility to the simulator. Pick whichever one you like! We'll teach the same principles with each facility.

            details: "A large substation critical to the operation of the Bulk Electric System - it even has a small control room. That large circuit breaker makes me tingly all over! <br/>Work location of some of the hottest workers this side of the interconnection. Hard hats, arc flash protection gear, and rubber lineman's gloves mean the sweat never stops at this facility."

            details: "A large fossil plant. If the unit doesn't look big enough to generate that many MW, use your imagination. This is a simulator after all. <br?>Coal ash, blistering steam, high voltage electricity, and enough kinetic energy to tear a building apart? If Mike Rowe started a show called Dangerous Jobs, these workers would be the stars."

This particular center also operates a sweet anti-spacecraft Tesla Cannon, critical to the defense of the BES from the bots. <br/>With this setup you could run a killer game of tic-tac-toe or Global Thermonuclear War. Would you like to play a game?"
