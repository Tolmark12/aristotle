                body: To prevent physical attacks,  <a data-label="cip">CIP<a> requires that we physically surround our  <a data-label="crca">CRCAs<a> with  <a data-label="psp" class="new">Physical Security Perimeter (PSP)<a> made up of walls, fences, and doors to keep the robots and their allies out. We install physical access controls that only allow authorized Defenders inside the PSP, log all access attempts, and alert when unauthorized people (or robots) try to gain access. An example of an access control is an ID-badge reader on the outside of the door connected to a computer inside that operates the reader and performs logging and alerting. These controls are considered  <a data-label="crca">CRCAs<a> and our  <a data-label="medium">Medium Impact<a> facilities must have one control per door, while  <a data-label="high">High Impact<a> facilities require two independent controls per door.
