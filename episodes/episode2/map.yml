                title: BES Cyber Assets
                body: Our job is to protect the programmable equipment - Cyber Assets - in our facilities. Specifically, CIP protects equipment that will cause real-time operational problems for the Bulk Electric System if they are hacked, attacked, or disabled. Think control systems, relay devices, and other equipment. CIP calls these BES Cyber Assets (BCA). <br/>Our Compliance Team has already identified the BCA in this facility. Let me put tags on the devices so we can see which ones are BCA.

                body: CIP requires us to inventory every BCA and PCA, along with all BCSI locations, onto Asset Lists. These form the core of what we protect with our CIP defenses. The CIP defenses we add to the facility will often require servers and software of their own to operate. For example, a door control system might have a server that logs entry and exit. These defensive assets will also be included on the asset lists and get their own unmemorable CIP acronyms like "PACS" and "EACMS". We'll discuss these assets further as we add them to the facility in future episodes.

The Program defines the jobs of our Defenders - to learn and Perform Duties that secure our infrastructure and to Create Evidence that those duties were performed duties correctly. CIP requires we communicate duties to Defenders through dedicated CIP security training and regular awareness campaigns. <br/>Did you notice something, Cadet? While leadership may define the Program and provide training and tools, success depends on everyone doing their duties. Protecting our infrastructure is a team effort and that's why we don't give out the title "Defender" lightly.

                body: The government wants to ensure our organization sustains the defenses required by compliance, so Company Name Arizona Public Service is accountable to regulatory bodies. NERC is responsible for defining the CIP Standards and gives authority to Company Regulator WECC to help us interpret the Standards and ensure we are following them through audits. <br/>The evidence we create is critical to this relationship. It helps us identify and fix issues, and shows our regulators that we are holding fast against the robots. With all these duties to perform and evidence to record, it's probably a good time to touch on what happens when we miss performing a duty or creating evidence.

                body: A Good Catch is doing something that almost violates a CIP requirement. These are learning opportunities that allow us to improve our processes. <br/>Identify, Assess, and Track is when we violate a CIP requirement, but discover the issue and fix our processes so the issue won't happen again. <br/>A Violation is violating a CIP requirement that doesn't allow for Identify, Assess and Track, or our violation is caught by an auditor. Violations can come with big fines, up to $1,000,000 per day, per incident. <br/>Let's run these situations through the simulator and see if you can identify them.

Most importantly, we learned that our core mission as Defenders is to protect our infrastructure performing our duties and creating evidence. <br/>Let's test your knowledge and move onto the next episode where we'll build and secure the perimeters around our facility. Buckle up into your office chairs, because things are about to get really interesting. The robots are coming…
