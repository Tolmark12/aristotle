Multiple extra levels of defense guarantee that if the enemy ever gets inside a perimeter, they will still have an oily battle ahead of them. The first layer of asset defense is securing the \"ports\" or connections that an asset allows to itself. <br/>The simulator will illustrate how an attacker can connect to an asset even with strong perimeters in place."

                body: "Many common attacks happen when someone plugs a compromised USB drive or cell phone into a physical port on an asset, bypassing our perimeter defenses. CIP requires we protect an asset's physical ports from accidental plug-ins through physical locks, tamper tape, or disabling them through configuration. <br/>We must also protect electronic or \"logical\" ports on each asset. A robot who gets through our Electronic Security Perimeter will try to communicate with an asset through its network connection, so CIP requires that assets only allow approved electronic communication. To do this, we install software firewalls (or similar protections) on assets that deny all unnecessary electronic communication. We document an exception for assets that don't support this protection. <br/>Technical defenders typically perform this process, but system users are responsible not to go around these defenses."

                body: "The software installed on our assets often has security flaws and our enemies like to use these flaws to launch attacks. Most software companies provide updates called \"patches\" that fix these flaws as they are discovered, so CIP requires we regularly apply any security-related patches on all software installed on each asset. This includes the operating system, your work item tracking tool, or your Global Robo-Nuclear WarTM game. <br/>At least once every 35 days, we look for new security patches and assess them. Within 35 days of assessment, we either 1.) install the patch or 2.) create a security mitigation plan if the patch causes computer problems or reliability issues. If a vendor doesn't create patches for their software, we must document an exception. <br/>Technical defenders typically perform this process, but system users may experience downtime or restarts during patching cycles."

                body: "What happens if a virus or other malicious code (called malware) gets through our defenses onto an asset? Is all hope lost? No - CIP requires another layer of defense that typically consists of installing anti-virus or anti-malware software on a computer that identifies and removes any malware that gets on the asset. The robots and their allies are constantly creating new malware, so CIP requires that we regularly update our software so it can detect the latest malware threats. There are other ways to protect against malware, but this method is very common. <br/>Technical defenders typically maintain the anti-malware software. System users often inadvertently install malware through their actions, so everyone must be vigilant."
