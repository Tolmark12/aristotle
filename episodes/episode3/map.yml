                body: We have a facility loaded up with juicy cyber assets that the bots want to get their hands on. An attacker can destroy or compromise anything they have physical access to, so our first job is to physically protect these assets. Let’s fire up the simulator to illustrate an attack the CIP-required physical defenses protect us from.

                title: Physical Access Control
                body: To prevent physical attacks, the CIP Standards require that we physically surround our core assets with Physical Security Perimeters (PSPs) made up of walls, fences, and doors to keep the robots and their allies out. We install door controls that only allow authorized Defenders inside the PSP, log all access attempts, and alert when unauthorized people (or robots) try to gain access. Our Medium Impact facilities have one control, while High Impact facilities require two independent controls per access point. <br/>These access control devices are called Physical Access Control Systems (PACS). An example of a PACS is an ID-badge reader on the outside of the door connected to a computer inside that operates the reader and does logging and alerting. A PACS is a defensive asset and will be added to our official asset lists.

                body: To defend our assets against electronic attacks, we must build an Electronic Security Perimeter (ESP) around the network that our BCA and PCA are connected to. CIP requires that we only allow communication in and out of the ESP network that is approved and business justified, ensuring the bad guys and bots can't communicate with our assets in the ESP. CIP also requires that we detect unauthorized electronic activity and alert Defenders if we detect something malicious. <br/>The most common way to meet the CIP requirements is to install Firewall between the ESP network and other networks. Firewalls can prevent unauthorized messages from getting through and often come equipped with Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) that inspect the contents of electronic messages and alert Defenders if something malicious is found. Electronic defense assets like firewalls are called Electronic Access Control and Managemement Systems (EACMS) - that's a mouthful! - and will be added to our official asset lists.nt Systems (EACMS) - that's a mouthful! - and will be added to our official asset lists.  t Systems (EACMS) - that's a mouthful! - and will be added to our official asset lists.  nt Systems (EACMS) - that's a mouthful! - and will be added to our official asset lists.
