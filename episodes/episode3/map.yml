                body: We have a facility loaded up with juicy cyber assets that the bots want to get their hands on. An attacker can destroy or compromise anything they have physical access to, so our first job is to physically protect these assets. Letâ€™s fire up the simulator to illustrate an attack the CIP-required physical defenses protect us from.

                title: Physical Access Control
                body: To prevent physical attacks, the CIP Standards require that we physically surround our core assets with Physical Security Perimeters (PSPs) made up of walls, fences, and doors to keep the robots and their allies out. We install door controls that only allow authorized Defenders inside the PSP, log all access attempts, and alert when unauthorized people (or robots) try to gain access. Our Medium Impact facilities have one control, while High Impact facilities require two independent controls per access point. <br/>These access control devices are called Physical Access Control Systems (PACS). An example of a PACS is an ID-badge reader on the outside of the door connected to a computer inside that operates the reader and does logging and alerting. A PACS is a defensive asset and will be added to our official asset lists.
